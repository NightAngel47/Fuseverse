"Calcium,Calcium is part of many compounds that we use to create building materials, including limestone, cement, and lime plaster."
"Chlorine,Chlorine Gas is 2.5 times heavier than Earth’s atmosphere."
"Chlorine,Chlorine is highly poisonous in large quantities."
"Chlorine,Chlorine is often mixed with other elements to create compounds, such as the chemicals found in chlorine pools."

"Fluorine,Fluoride, a mineral that comes from Fluorine, is commonly used in the dentist office to strengthen teeth."
"Fluorine,Fluorine is one of the most toxic elements in the world."
"Hydrogen,Hydrogen appears first on the periodic table and is the simplest and most common element in the universe."
"Hydrogen,All known gas giant planets contain mostly Hydrogen, but due to ultraviolet rays from the sun and water, they all appear to be different colors!"
"Hydrogen,The sun and other stars fuse Hydrogen into Helium in their cores, which releases huge amounts of energy in the form of light and heat."
"Iodine,Trace amounts of Iodine can be found in most foods, especially seafood and dairy products."
"Iodine,Iodine is commonly used in sanitation systems to kill bacteria and germs."
"Iodine,Iodine is essential to regulate the thyroid gland, and too little iodine can cause stunted growth or delayed brain growth."
"Lithium,Lithium is believed to be one of the 3 elements produced by the Big Bang."
"Lithium,Lithium is the lightest metal on the Periodic Table."
"Lithium,A compound called Lithium Hydroxide, which is produced in part from Lithium, is used to purify air in spacecrafts and submarines."
"Magnesium,Magnesium is formed in stars with a mass of eight or more of the sun."
"Magnesium,Magnesium is used to make bright white sparkles in fireworks."
"Magnesium,13% of Earth’s mass is made up of Magnesium, which is enough Magnesium to make another planet the same mass as Mars and make 3 more Earth moons."
"Nitrogen,Nitrogen makes up 78% of the Earth’s Atmosphere, as well as 78% of the air we breathe."
"Nitrogen,Titan, the largest moon of Saturn, has an atmosphere made up of over 98% Nitrogen, making it the only moon in our solar system known to have a dense atmosphere."
"Nitrogen,Nitrogen is a versatile gas, and is used to make fuel, explosives, food preservatives, electronics, and much more."
"Potassium,Potassium is an essential element for both animal and plant life."
"Potassium,Potassium is violently reactive when mixed with water, and will cause an explosive reaction."
"Potassium,Potassium is a common ingredient used to create gunpowder and fireworks."
"Rubidium,Rubidium is sometimes used to create a violet-red color in fireworks."
"Rubidium,Rubidium will spontaneously combust in air and will violently react with water."
"Rubidium,Rubidium Chloride, a compound of Rubidium, has been found to be a good therapy treatment for Depression."
"Sodium,Sodium is found in Mercury’s atmosphere, the tails of comets and meteors, the exosphere of the moon, and even extrasolar planets."
"Sodium,Sodium has a strong spectral line in the yellow-orange part of the color spectrum, which is used to find planets and other space objects."
"Sodium,Even though Sodium burns yellow, planets without a cloud covering would appear a deeper blue than Earth’s sky because of the presence of Sodium, which absorbs red light."
"Strontium,Because Strontium burns red, it’s commonly used for emergency flares."
"Strontium,In some forms, Strontium can be used for generating electricity in a spaceship!"
"Strontium,trontium is the element used to create bright red fireworks."
"Oxygen,Excited Oxygen is what gives the Aurora Borealis its bright red, green, and yellow green lights."
"Oxygen,Oxygen is essential to life, as all plants and animals both require it for cellular respiration."
"Oxygen,Fire requires Oxygen in order to burn, however Oxygen itself is non-combustible."
"Rings,Rings always rotate with a Gas Giant planet at its equator."
"Rings,Most Gas Giant rings are made up of ice chunks, rocks, and small moons."
"Rings,The size of rocks in a ring system can be as small as a speck of dust to as big as a mountain."
"Rings,All Gas Giant planets have some sort of ring system. There are some so faint you can’t see them, but others are as big as Saturn’s."
"Rings,Gas Giants are not the only planet to have rings. Dwarf planets, centaurs (Small solar system bodies), and exoplanets can also have ring systems."
