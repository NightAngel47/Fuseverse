"ArcticTundra,Below its icy layer, the Arctic Tundra’s ground experiences permafrost, which means the topsoil is frozen all year."
"ArcticTundra,Arctic Tundras on Earth only happen in the far north along the Arctic Circle."
"ArcticTundra,Arctic Tundras cannot support a diversity of plant life because there is not enough nutrients in the soil. Plant life is limited to shrubs and grasses."
"Oceania,Oceans can lead to the formation of tectonic plates, which cause earthquakes and tidal waves."
"Oceania,Aquatic life below the surface of the water thrives because of nutrients that volcanoes emit."
"Oceania,Most life begins underwater, and can eventually evolve into land-dwelling life through evolution."
"Savanna,The African Savannas are home to one of the most dependent and complex ecosystems in the world. Removing 1 animal would cause the ecosystem to alter."
"Savanna,Savannas are mostly made up of different types of grasses and soils with only some trees scattered throughout."
"Savanna,Savannas tend to go through 2 seasons, a wet and dry season, with the dry season usually being longer than the wet season."
"TaigaForest,Coniferous Forests are home to Giant Sequoia Trees, which are some of the longest living trees on Earth at more than 3,000 years old and still growing."
"TaigaForest,Coniferous Forests are the most uninhabited biomes by urban centers, making it the biome with the lowest overall population density on a human scale."
"TaigaForest,The needle trees, often referred to as conifer or evergreen trees, that exist in Coniferous Forests have a waxy outer coating that hold moisture and prevent freezing, allowing them to thrive in cold climates."
"TemperateDesert,Temperate Deserts have high temperatures in the summer, and low temperatures in the winter."
"TemperateDesert,Temperate Deserts can exist as both hot deserts and cold deserts. The largest desert on Earth is actually a cold desert, the Antarctic Desert, which is located at the South Pole."
"TemperateDesert,Some examples of animals that live in Temperate Deserts are road runners, desert camels, and jackrabbits."
"TemperateForest,The most common trees found in Deciduous Forests include maple, oak, and beech trees."
"TemperateForest,Deciduous Forests experience all 4 seasons, evidenced in how their leaves change and shed."
"TemperateForest,Deciduous Forests are organized to 5 zones based on the height of trees. These include the ground zone, herb zone, shrub zone, small tree and sapling zone, and the tree stratum zone."
"TemperateGrasslands,Illinois is known as the Prairie state, and before being settled, it consisted entirely of Prairie grasslands."
"TemperateGrasslands,North American Prairies are the most ideal ecosystem for agriculture, and as a result of converting them for farmland, less than 0.01% of the original Prairies still exist."
"TemperateGrasslands,Prairie ecosystems are only 8,000 years old and exist primarily in North America."
"TropicalDesert,The largest Tropical Desert in the world is the Sahara Desert in Africa, which is home to one of the harshest climates on Earth, and yet houses a vast amount of wildlife."
"TropicalDesert,Tropical Deserts are the hottest biomes on Earth, and on average get less than 10 inches of rain a year."
"TropicalDesert,Wind in Tropical Deserts play a huge role in landforms in the desert, as wind carries sand and other debris, leaving depressions and making dunes."
"Atmosphere,A planet’s atmosphere is mostly made up of Nitrogen, Oxygen, and Carbon Dioxide."
"Atmosphere,The color of a planet’s atmosphere is mainly determined by a process called scattering, which is how much ultraviolet light from the sun is hitting the atmosphere and the particles bending that light."
"Atmosphere,Without an atmosphere protecting the planet from the Sun, life would not be able to exist on Earth."
"Atmosphere,Earth’s atmosphere is 78% Nitrogen and 21% Oxygen and has 5 layers: troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere, thermosphere, and exosphere."
"Atmosphere,Natural disasters, such as hurricanes and volcanic eruptions, can change the color of an atmosphere because of the particles they release."
"SingleBiome,A planet with a single biome cannot support an ecosystem"","" which means that it cannot support any life."
