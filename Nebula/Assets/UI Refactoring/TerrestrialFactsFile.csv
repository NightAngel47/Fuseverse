"ArcticTundra,An ice age has struck your planet, most of the surface is arctic tundra and will take thousands of years to thaw."
"ArcticTundra,Your planet is slowly thawing out of an ice age, a period of time where the whole planet freezes."
"ArcticTundra,Your planet is very far away from the sun, causing little heat and light to reach it."
"Oceania,Your planet has just thawed out of an Ice Age, causing most of the planet to be covered in water."
"Oceania,The water covering your planet supports many types of life below the surface."
"Oceania,The aquatic life below the surface of the water thrives because of the nutrients that the volcanoes give off."
"Savanna,There is a complex food chain of many different types of predators and prey roaming throughout the rolling savannahs."
"Savanna,The main biome of your planet, savannah, is also called tropical grasslands."
"Savanna,A variety of animals can survive in the savannahs of your planet."
"TaigaForest,The large coniferous trees on your planet are resilient to the cold conditions that your planet has."
"TaigaForest,The majority of the trees on your planet are similar to pine trees."
"TaigaForest,The Taiga Forests of your planet are also known as boreal forests."
"TemperateDesert,The surface of your planet is dry and hot, this formed many deserts over the years."
"TemperateDesert,Your planet is close to the sun, causing the surface to be dry and hot."
"TemperateDesert,Little life lives on your planet due to the hot dry climate."
"TemperateForest,The forests on your planet support many forms of life."
"TemperateForest,The dense forests cover most of your planet's surface, blocking most light from reaching the ground."
"TemperateForest,The food on your planet is plentiful due to the number of trees that produce fruit."
"TemperateGrasslands,The amount of rain in the grasslands of your planet is not enough to grow tall trees but supports life."

"Atmosphere,A planet’s atmosphere is mostly made up of Nitrogen, Oxygen, and Carbon Dioxide."
"Atmosphere,The color of a planet’s atmosphere is mainly determined by a process called scattering, which is how much ultraviolet light is hitting the atmosphere and the particles bending that light."
"Atmosphere,Earth’s sky is actually purple, it only looks blue because water particles in the sky scatter the light to make it blue."
"Atmosphere,Without an atmosphere protecting your planet from the sun, life would not be able to exist on your planet."
"Atmosphere,Earth’s Atmosphere is 78% Nitrogen and 21% Oxygen and has 5 layers: troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere, thermosphere, and exosphere."
"Atmosphere,Natural disasters, such as Hurricanes and Volcanic Eruptions, can change the color of an atmosphere because of the particles they release."
